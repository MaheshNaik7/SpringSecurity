# SpringSecurity
Spring Security in Spring Boot enables authentication and authorization through various methods such as form-based login, OAuth integration for third-party authentication, and JWT token-based authentication for stateless communication. It also supports role-based access control (RBAC) and method-level security annotations for fine-grained authorization.
